I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input clk
 - input d
 - output q

The module should implement a single D flip-flop. Assume all sequential
logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.


#Code Llama Output

Here's an example implementation of a TopModule with the given interface:
```scss
module TopModule(input clk, input d, output q);
  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (d == 1) begin
      q <= 0;
    end else begin
      q <= 1;
    end
  end
endmodule
```
This module has three inputs: `clk`, `d`, and `q`. The input `clk` is the clock signal, which determines when
sequential logic is triggered. The input `d` is the data input, which determines the value of the flip-flop on the
positive edge of the clock. The output `q` is the current value of the flip-flop.

The module uses the `always @(posedge clk)` construct to specify that the sequential logic should be triggered on
the positive edge of the clock. Inside this block, the module checks whether the input `d` is high (i.e., 1) or
low (i.e., 0), and updates the output accordingly. The `if-else` statement is used to ensure that the output is
updated correctly even if the input `d` is unknown (i.e., X) or high-impedance (i.e., Z).

Note that this implementation assumes that all inputs are single bits, and that the output is also a single bit.
If you want to handle multi-bit inputs and outputs, you can use an array of `reg` variables instead of a single
`reg` variable for the output.
